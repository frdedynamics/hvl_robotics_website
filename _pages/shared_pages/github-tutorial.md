<!-- # Github Tutorial -->
It is sad to see an engineer or a developer who cannot use Git in 2025. Even if those people know what Git is and know how to use it to some extend, they don't use it efficiently due to two common reasons:
1. Following things (changes) in terminal is not intuitive or is scary,
2. don't want to mess with merge conflicts.

Through these video tutorials about Git on VScode, I aimed to overcome these issues. Please watch if you feel uncomfortable using Git or afraid of collaborating people through Git since you don't want to *mess things up.*
