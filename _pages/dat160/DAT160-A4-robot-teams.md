This assignment should warm you up with your reflection on both robot and multi-robot software architectures. The assignment is related to your semester project, hence the answers depends on your reflection about your solution and design choices.

The submission is individual. Since you are working in teams in the software project, it is expected that your answers deal with the same solutions. However, your reflection about the solutions/design choices, and your justification for these reflections, are individual.

You will be allowed to consolidate your answers and incorporate them as an appendix before the deadline for submitting your project reports. Follow-up on Canvas.
